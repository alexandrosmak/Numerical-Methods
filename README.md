- ðŸ‘€ This chapter focuses on the development of sample codes which can be commonly employed to solve engineering problems that are associated with equations which can         not be solved analytically. Numerical methods solve problems by step-wise, repeatable and iterative solution methods. Common problems which require the use of           numerical methods include fluid transport, molecular and cellular mechanisms, and reaction networks among others.
