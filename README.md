- ðŸ‘€ This chapter focuses on the development of sample codes which can be commonly employed to solve engineering problems that are associated with equations which can         not be solved analytically. Numerical methods solve problems by step-wise, repeatable and iterative solution methods. Problems which require the use of numerical         methods include fluid transport, molecular and cellular mechanisms, reaction networks and electromagnetics among others.
